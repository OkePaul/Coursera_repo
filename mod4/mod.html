    NOTE! The steps in this file are basically identical to the ones you
performed in the SpeakHello.js file.

STEP 6: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakGoodBye.js inside of an IIFE
See Lecture 52, part 2


STEP 7: Create an object, called 'byeSpeaker' to which you will attach
the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
See Lecture 52, part 1
var byeSpeaker =

DO NOT attach the speakWord variable to the 'byeSpeaker' object.
var speakWord = "Good Bye";

STEP 8: Rewrite the 'speak' function such that it is attached to the
byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
See Lecture 52, part 2
function speak(name) {
  console.log(hello);
}
function hello(){
  console.log("hello world");
}

STEP 9: Expose the 'byeSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
'byeSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
xxxx.xxxx = byeSpeaker;
